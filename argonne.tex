\begin{abstract}
%The AIP Proceedings article template has many predefined paragraph styles for you to use/apply as you write your paper. To format your abstract, use the \LaTeX template style: {\itshape Abstract.} Each paper must include an abstract. Begin the abstract with the word ``Abstract'' followed by a period in bold font, and then continue with a normal 9 point font.
Rapidly growing data volumes at light sources demand increasingly automated data collection, distribution, and analysis processes, in order to enable new scientific discoveries while not overwhelming finite human capabilities. I present here three projects that use cloud-hosted data automation and enrichment services, institutional computing resources, and high- performance computing facilities to provide cost-effective, scalable, and reliable implementations of such processes. In the first, Globus cloud-hosted data automation services are used to implement data capture, distribution, and analysis workflows for Advanced Photon Source and Advanced Light Source beamlines, leveraging institutional storage and computing. In the second, such services are combined with cloud-hosted data indexing and institutional storage to create a collaborative data publication, indexing, and discovery service, the Materials Data Facility (MDF), built to support a host of informatics applications in materials science. The third integrates components of the previous two projects with machine learning capabilities provided by the Deep Learning Hub (DLHub) to enable on-demand access to machine learning models from light source data capture and analysis workflows, and provides simplified interfaces to train new models on data from sources such as MDF on leadership scale computing resources. I draw conclusions about best practices for building next-generation data automation systems for future light sources.

\section{PRACTICAL EXPERIENCES}

\subsection{Early Work}

We first experimented with online analysis of APS in the late 1990s, 
when we coupled 
computing microtomography~\cite{wang1999quasi,wang2001high} and with Westbrook~\cite{von2000using}.

In one memorable demonstration in 1998, we piped microtomography data from beamline 2-BM to a 96-node SGI Origin parallel computer 
at Argonne for incremental reconstruction via filtered backprojection as an experiment was proceeding,
and then streamed visualization data to the Supercomputing conference in Orlando, Florida, 
for interactive analysis. 
As we noted at the time, 
``the data rates and compute power required ... are prodigious, easily reaching one gigabit per second and a teraflop per second [respectively]"~\cite{von2000using}.

\section{RELATED WORK}

Coles et al.~\cite{coles2005ecses,coles2006science} developed an automated small molecule crystallography service that automated the
end-to-end-flow from sample receipt to results dissemination.
